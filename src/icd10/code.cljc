  "The ICD-10 code SHAPE: `letter + 2 digits`, optionally `.` + 1-2 further
  characters, plus the dagger/asterisk dual-classification suffix. This is
  structural grammar, not classification content — WHO's copyright covers
  the mapping from a code to a disease name/description, not the fact that
  codes are shaped this way. See this repo's README for exactly where that
  boundary is drawn and what consequently is NOT here (no code -> label
  table, no tabular list).

  Deliberately per-position validation (letter, then each digit, then each
  subcategory character, then the optional dagger/asterisk mark) rather
  than one `re-matches` against a single monolithic pattern: a single
  regex collapses every possible malformation into one generic \"no
  match\", which is the same failure this workspace's CLAUDE.md calls out
  for `.js`/`.mjs` test harnesses that assert only \"it failed somehow\" --
  a caller (and this repo's own negative tests) can tell a bad LETTER
  apart from a bad DIGIT apart from a too-long SUBCATEGORY, each as its own
  named `:icd10/...` reason."

  WHO's own 4-character `letter+2digits.digit` shape. `subcategory-warn`
