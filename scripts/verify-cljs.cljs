;; cljs) that feeds directly into `compare`/sort ordering, and
;; icd10.code does per-character classification via `re-matches` against
;; 1-character strings on both runtimes -- exactly the surface this
;; workspace's CLAUDE.md flags as having repeatedly diverged between JVM
;; and ClojureScript in past libraries here.
